This app is dedicated to find the best matching element within the target html file comparing to the element with specified id from original html file.

Input args are optional and respond to:
args[0] - path to original html

The app prints to the console the info about original element and the path to the resulting one.

The search is based on the comparison of the element from original html to the elements of target html of the same tag name
basing on the equality of attributes values and elements texts.
